# Welcome to Quaint Living - Flower Garden Redux

## What is this mod?
This is a conversion to 1.6 of Quaint Living - Flower Garden by PlatinumCats

## Why is this mod?
I was really missing some of the flowers from Quaint Living so I decided to convert it entirely to ContenPatcher and Spacecore.

## What do you need for it?
To play with this mod you'll need the latest version of SMAPI (of course), Content Patcher and SpaceCore.

## Is this compatible with X mod?
Quaint Living - Flower Garden Redux should be compatible with other mods seeing how it merely adds new flowers and some oils.

There are special configs so you don't get any duplicate flowers when playing with both Quaint Living - FLower Garden Redux and Quaint Living - Flower Garden 2.

## What to do with bugs
If you encounter any problems or bugs go to the issues tab here or bug tab on Nexus and tell me about it, I will need a SMAPI log or else I won't really be able to help you.

## Planned stuff
- Vanilla Tweaks seed bags for all flowers (I'm not a sprite artist so we'll see how that goes).
- Tweaking some of the code, especially gift tastes.
- Adding more gift tastes for Modded NPCs(?)
- Compatibility with Artisan Flower mods, more specifically converting Doragoun's Everlasting Flowers Quaint Living code to their 1.6 mod.
